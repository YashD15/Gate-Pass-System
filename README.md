# 💡 Gate Pass System  
🚀 *Digitize and Automate Visitor Entry Logging at Campus or Office Gates*  
**Gate Pass System** is a PHP-based web application that replaces the traditional manual register with a digital entry system. Visitors enter their details when visiting a **college** or **office campus**, and the system **generates a pass** with their information. On exit, scanning the pass logs the **exit time**, automating the visitor tracking process and ensuring proper monitoring.
